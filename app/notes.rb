# /specs/features/bpard_spec.rb is an integration test. Some things you should be aware of:
# => 1. These tests were done to create the page in a way so it displayed the relevant information
# => 2. I was not sure the route you wanted to go with how to display the items, but I thought it may be helpful if:
#         - There was a description/name/something in the dart migration so that the alt (for visually impaired people)
#             could have a description. Then again im sure they wouldnt use manterest.....
#         - I was unsure about how many photos you wanted to display on the board page. It seemed like you wanted 
#             to display all the boards and then all the photos on each board. Thats what i did. Please change it if it is not good.  
#
# => 3. I was unsure of where the photos should link to. The darts show page doesn't seem to be the right
#         place for what is there. I would recommend having a dartboard view that shows the darts. Each 
#         individual dart "show" should be something else or nothing, not a list of all darts b/c it doesn't
#         an individual dart doesn't have a dart list. But I could be wrong, just a suggestion.
